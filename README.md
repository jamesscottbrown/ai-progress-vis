# AI progress visualiser

This presents a visualisation of the EFF's AI Progress Mesaurement project ([Jupyter notebook](https://www.eff.org/ai/metrics), [blog post announcement](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/06/help-eff-track-progress-ai-and-machine-learning)).

Data is presented in two panels: the left displays a tree of problems/subproblems and metrics, whilst the right deisplays the measurements for a particular metric as a coupled table and scatterplot.

Data is loaded directly from the [JSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AI-metrics/AI-metrics/master/export-api/v01/progress.json) in the [main AI-metrics github repository](https://github.com/AI-metrics/AI-metrics), so should remain up-to-date.
