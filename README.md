# AI progress visualizer

[View visualizations](https://jamesscottbrown.github.io/ai-progress-vis/)

This presents a visualisation of the EFF's AI Progress Measurement project ([Jupyter notebook](https://www.eff.org/ai/metrics), [blog post announcement](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/06/help-eff-track-progress-ai-and-machine-learning)).

Data is presented in two panels. The left displays a tree of problems/subproblems and metrics. Clicking on a the name of a metric displays the corresponding measurements in the right panel as a coupled table and scatterplot.

Data is loaded directly from the [JSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AI-metrics/AI-metrics/master/export-api/v01/progress.json) in the [main AI-metrics github repository](https://github.com/AI-metrics/AI-metrics), so should remain up-to-date.
